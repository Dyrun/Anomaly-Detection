# Flight Telemetry Anomaly Detection System - Work in progress

A real-time, multi-language anomaly detection system for flight telemetry data using machine learning.

## Overview

This system monitors aircraft engine vibration patterns in real-time to detect potential engine failures using an Isolation Forest algorithm. It consists of:

- **C++ Flight Simulator**: Generates realistic telemetry data
- **Python ML Engine**: Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
- **Node.js Backend**: REST API for data serving
- **React Frontend**: Real-time visualization dashboard
